# Timestamp-Microservice
Simple unix timestamp node server.

Simple node app that returns both unix and natural time after being queried 
with one or the other, thus being a simple converter between them.
This project was made and updated with glitch, here is the link: https://timestampcallback.glitch.me/

First project I have made using both node and express. 
Huge thanks to Daniel Shiffman and his wonderful youtube tutorial 
called Programming with Text that walks through how to make
a node server. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oiabY1xpBo
